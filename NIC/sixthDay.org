* Firewalld
=Firewalld is a dynamically managed firewall solution for Linux systems that provides a high-level interface for managing firewall rules. It is designed to be more user-friendly and flexible than traditional static firewall configurations.=
** Zone
A zone is a predefined set of rules that specify the level of trust for a network or interface. Each zone has its own set of rules for incoming and outgoing traffic. Examples include public, work, home, internal, and external.
** Service:
A service is a predefined set of rules that define access to specific network services. For example, there are services for HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, FTP, etc. Services are associated with specific ports and protocols.
** Rich Rule:
Rich rules provide a more flexible way to define firewall rules using a syntax that allows complex conditions. Rich rules are often used for more advanced configurations beyond the capabilities of predefined services.
** Permanent vs. Runtime:
Changes to the firewall configuration can be made either permanently (persist across reboots) or at runtime (applied immediately but not persisted). The --permanent option is used for permanent changes.
** Default Zone:
The default zone is the zone assigned to network interfaces that are not explicitly configured. It determines the default behavior for incoming and outgoing traffic.
** Reload:
After making changes to the firewall configuration, the --reload command is used to apply the new settings without restarting the entire firewall.
** Masquerade:
Masquerading is a form of Network Address Translation (NAT) that allows a network to share a single public IP address. It is often used when a local network needs to access the internet through a single external IP.
** Port Forwarding:
Port forwarding allows incoming traffic on a specific port to be redirected to a different port or IP address. This can be useful for exposing services on internal networks to the outside world.
** Reject vs. Drop:
Reject sends an error message back to the source, indicating that the connection was not allowed. Drop simply discards the packet without sending any notification.
** Source and Destination:
Rules can be specified based on the source and destination addresses. Understanding how to use these parameters allows you to control traffic based on the origin or destination of packets.
** Logging:
Enabling logging for specific rules can help you monitor the firewall's activity. It allows you to see which packets are matching a particular rule.
** Interfaces:
Interfaces represent network connections on your system. You can associate specific rules or zones with specific interfaces to control traffic.
** ~Firewalld config~
*** Install
~sudo yum install firewalld~
~sudo apt install firewalld~

*** Start and enable service
~sudo systemctl start firewalld~
~sudo systemctl enable firewalld~
~sudo systemctl status firewalld~

** Basic Firewalld Config
*** List all rules
~sudo firewall-cmd --list-all~
*** Drop port 22
~sudo firewall-cmd --add-rich-rule='rule family="ipv4" service name="ssh" drop'~
*** Block ivp-4 address
~sudo firewall-cmd --add-rich-rule='rule family="ipv4" source address="<ip-addr>" drop'~
*** Note: firewalld doesn't use explicit rule indexes
*** Block All Incoming Traffic
~sudo firewall-cmd --set-default-zone=drop~
*** Flush All Rules
~sudo firewall-cmd --complete-reload~

* UFW
=ufw stands for Uncomplicated Firewall. It is a user-friendly command-line interface for managing iptables, the default firewall management tool in many Linux distributions. ufw aims to simplify the process of configuring a firewall, making it more accessible to users who may not be familiar with iptables syntax.=
** Listing Rules
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   sudo ufw status verbose
   #+END_SRC

** Block Port Number
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   sudo ufw deny 22
   #+END_SRC

** Block IP Address
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   sudo ufw deny from <ip-addr>
   #+END_SRC
   
** Add Rule at Specific Index
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   sudo ufw insert 1 allow from <ip-addr> to any app OpenSSH
   #+END_SRC

** Block All Incoming Traffic
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   sudo ufw default deny incoming
   #+END_SRC

** Flush All Rules
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   sudo ufw reset
   #+END_SRC

** Save and Restore Rules
*** Save the Rules
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   sudo ufw status verbose > /etc/ufw/rules.v4
   #+END_SRC

*** Restore the Rules
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   sudo ufw --force reload
   #+END_SRC

* Samba Server
=Samba is a free and open-source implementation of the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, which is used for sharing files, printers, and other resources between computers on a network.=
** File Sharing
    Samba allows you to share files and directories between computers, regardless of their operating systems. It facilitates seamless file sharing between Windows, Linux, and macOS systems.
    Use: You can use a Samba server to create shared folders on a Linux server, making them accessible to Windows machines as if they were regular network drives.
*** Installation and Configutaion
**** Download and install
~sudo dnf install samba samba-client samba-common~
**** Enable samba through firewall
~sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service=samba~
~sudo firewall-cmd --reload~

**** Create a Directory for sharing
~sudo mkdir -p /samba/apps~
~sudo chmod 777 /samba~
~sudo chmod 777 /samba/apps~
~sudo touch /samba/apps/fileByServer~
**** Config File
~sudo mv /etc/samba/smb.conf /etc/samba/smb.conf.bak~
~sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf~
#+BEGIN_SRC ini
[global]
        workgroup = SAMBA
        netbios name = ubuntu
        security = user
        map to guest = bad user
        dns proxy = no
[Apps]
        comment = Samba Shared Directory
        path = /samba/apps
        browsable = yes
        writable = yes
        guest ok = yes
        guest only = yes
        read only = no
#+END_SRC
**** Test the config file
~testparm~
**** Start the Samba server
~sudo systemctl start smb nmb~
**** SMB and NMB
=SMB is a network file sharing protocol. It allows applications on a computer to read and write to files and to request services from server programs in a computer network.=

=NetBIOS is an acronym for Network Basic Input/Output System. It provides services related to the session layer of the OSI model, allowing applications on separate computers to communicate over a local area network.=
**** Client side config
***** Linux
~sudo apt install cifs-utils samba-client~
~sudo mount -t cifs //<ip-addr>/Apps /path/to/mount~
***** Windows
On Windows file manager location bar Type
~\\<ip-addr>~

** Printer Sharing
    Samba enables the sharing of printers over a network, allowing multiple users to print to a single printer connected to the Samba server.
    Use: With Samba, you can set up a centralized print server that can be accessed by various devices across different platforms.
    Link to configure: https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/samba-print-server
** Integration with Active Directory
    Definition: Samba supports integration with Microsoft Active Directory, enabling seamless collaboration between Linux/Unix systems and Windows environments.
    Use: By integrating with Active Directory, Samba allows Linux servers to participate in Windows-based networks, providing a unified authentication and authorization system.
    Link: https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/windows_integration_guide/winbind
** Cross-Platform Compatibility
    Definition: Samba ensures interoperability between Windows, Linux, and macOS systems by implementing the SMB protocol, allowing file and print services to be shared across different platforms.
    Use: Users can access shared resources on a Samba server using Windows Explorer, macOS Finder, or Linux file managers, fostering collaboration in heterogeneous network environments.
